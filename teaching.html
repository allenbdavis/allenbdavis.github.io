								<h3>International School of Boston</h3>
								<p>I began teaching at ISB in August 2020, right after defending my Ph.D. Most of my time is spent in the upper school teaching physics, but I also teach mathematics, computer science, and astrophysics when the opportunity arises.</p>

								<h4>Physics</h4>
								<p><a href="https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/sciences/physics/"><strong>IB Physics</strong></a> is a two-year course fulfilling the science requirement for 11th and 12th grade students pursuing the International Baccalaureate Diploma. It covers a wide range of topics — mechanics, electricity and magnetism, waves, fields, and nuclear physics — with Higher Level students exploring additional territory including thermodynamics, quantum physics, and special relativity.</p>

								<p><strong>MYP Physics</strong> is a one-year course for 10th graders. It introduces the core ideas of physics through hands-on investigation and real-world application, building the foundation students will need for IB and beyond.</p>

								<p><strong>Astronomy Club</strong> meets weekly during lunch, where students discuss current events in space science, ask bold questions about the universe, and occassionally chat with invited professional astrophysicists from the Boston area. A few times each year we meet in the evening to observe the planets and the brightest deep sky objects with an 8" telescope. In 2024, we took a field trip to Texas to see the total solar eclipse.</p>

								<h4>Mathematics</h4>
								<!-- <p>I have taught a range of math courses at ISB, from standard 10th grade math to advanced topics for motivated students in the French Baccalaureate track. I especially enjoy teaching math to students who don't yet see themselves as "math people" — there's something deeply satisfying about helping a student reach a moment of clarity on a concept they'd found intimidating.</p> -->

								<p><strong>Integrated Math 2</strong> is a course for 10th graders at the standard level. We cover algebra, geometry, and statistics, as well as a unit introducing students to the basics of coding in Python.</p>
								
								<p><strong>Advanced Math Topics</strong> is a course I teach in grade 9, 10, and 11 for talented math students pursuing the French Bac. In weekly class meetings I suppplement student's math instruction with more tangential or advanced topics. Examples of topics include linear programming, solving trig equations, Monte Carlo integration, and Euler's method.</p>

								<p><strong>Math Enrichment</strong> is my only middle school course, intended for motivated 7th graders. As with Advanced Math, I meet with students weekly to explore broad areas in mathematics. Examples of topics include the basics of first-order logic, Euler diagrams, sequences, introduction to Python coding, and fractals.</p>

								<h4>Computer Science</h4>
								<p>My background in scientific research gives me an appreciation of the power and importance of programming. I have taken a leading role in integrating programming instruction into our middle school and upper school math programs.</p>
								
								<p>In 2025, I was awarded an <strong>AI Grant</strong> to develop a high school unit focused on teaching students to productively use AI coding assistance to enhance their ability to take charge of their learning. In this unit, 11th graders with intermediate programming skills, were able to perform PhD-level work identifying genes in DNA with proper use of AI assistance. As a final project, students created games that far exceeded their previous abilities.</p>

								<p><strong>Sciences Numériques et Technologie</strong> (Digital Sciences and Technology) is a required 10th grade course in the French Bac, which I co-teach. Students learn the basics of Python and html, as well as how to interact with digital images and databases.</p>

								<p><strong>Coding Club</strong> is a weekly lunch club I advise, which gives high school students the opportunity to pursue self-directed programming projects with my guidance and mentorship. Some students work through Python tutorials; others produce websites, games, or work on independent projects in basic science, finance, or community service.</p>

								<h3>Yale University</h3>
								<p>During my five years as a Teaching Fellow at Yale, I discovered something I hadn't fully expected: I loved teaching. Running weekly discussion sections gave me the chance to slow down and really engage with students' questions — to find out where understanding was breaking down and figure out, together, how to rebuild it. Working alongside Prof. Debra Fischer and Prof. Michael Faison, both gifted educators, taught me a great deal about how to make challenging ideas feel accessible and genuinely exciting. Those years in the classroom shaped the kind of teacher I wanted to become.</p>

									<li>ASTR 135: Archaeoastronomy, Prof. Michael Faison (Spring 2016)</li>
									<li>ASTR 120: Galaxies and the Universe, Prof. Michael Faison (Spring 2015)</li>

								<h3>Williams College</h3>
								<p>My journey as an educator really started at Williams, where I spent three years as a Teaching Assistant and Head Teaching Assistant at the Milham Planetarium and Hopkins Observatory. As Head TA at the planetarium, I presented shows to school groups, astronomy classes, and the general public — and I trained other student lecturers to do the same. There is something uniquely powerful about standing under a dome full of stars and watching someone experience the night sky in a new way. I also worked at the Hopkins Observatory, guiding students through telescope observations and one-on-one tutoring. More recently, I've returned to Williams as an invited guest lecturer in undergraduate astronomy courses covering planets, the Milky Way, and stellar physics.</p>

								<h3>Private Tutoring and Mentoring</h3>
								<p>Since 2019, I've worked privately with high school and college students across a range of subjects, including IB Physics, Chemistry, Algebra II, SAT Math prep, and Python programming. At the college level, I've tutored students in calculus-based electricity and magnetism — a course many students find to be a genuine turning point in their physics education.</p>

								<p>Some of my most rewarding work has been mentoring students through independent research projects. Guiding a motivated teenager through their first real scientific investigation — helping them form a question, design a method, wrestle with unexpected results, and present their findings — is one of the most meaningful things I do. It's the kind of experience that can genuinely change a student's relationship to science.</p>
