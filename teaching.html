								<h3>International School of Boston</h3>
								<p>I began teaching at ISB in August 2020, right after defending my Ph.D. Most of my time is spent in the upper school teaching physics, but I also teach mathematics, computer science, and — whenever the opportunity arises — astrophysics. ISB is a wonderful international community, and I feel lucky to work with students who bring so many different perspectives and curiosities into the classroom.</p>

								<h4>Physics</h4>
								<p><a href="https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/sciences/physics/">IB Physics</a> is a two-year course fulfilling the science requirement for 11th and 12th grade students pursuing the International Baccalaureate Diploma. It covers a wide range of topics — mechanics, electricity and magnetism, waves, fields, and nuclear physics — with Higher Level students exploring additional territory including thermodynamics, quantum physics, and special relativity. I love this course because it consistently asks students to think like physicists, not just solve problems.</p>

								<p>MYP Physics is a required one-year course for 10th graders. It introduces the core ideas of physics through hands-on investigation and real-world application, building the foundation students will need for IB and beyond.</p>

								<p>I also advise the <strong>Astronomy Club</strong>, where students observe the night sky, discuss current events in space science, and occasionally tackle their own observational projects. It's one of my favorite parts of the school week.</p>

								<ul>
									<li>11th &amp; 12th grade IB Physics, Standard and Higher Level (SY2020–present)</li>
									<li>10th grade MYP Physics (SY2020–present)</li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Mathematics</h4>
								<p>I've taught a range of math courses at ISB, from standard 10th grade math to advanced topics for motivated students in the French Baccalaureate track. I especially enjoy teaching math to students who don't yet see themselves as "math people" — there's something deeply satisfying about helping a student reach a moment of clarity on a concept they'd found intimidating.</p>

								<p><em>Courses marked * are in the French Baccalaureate track, taught in English.</em></p>
								<ul>
									<li>10th grade Math Standard Level (SY2020–2021, SY2022–2023)</li>
									<li>11th grade Advanced Math Topics* (SY2023–present)</li>
									<li>10th grade Advanced Math Topics* (SY2022–present)</li>
									<li>9th grade Advanced Math Topics* (SY2022–present)</li>
									<li>7th grade Math Enrichment (SY2021–present)</li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Computer Science</h4>
								<p>Technology and computation are woven into modern science, and I think every student benefits from understanding how computers work and how to make them do useful things. I teach 10th grade Sciences Numériques et Technologie (SNT), a French Baccalaureate course that introduces students to digital technology — from networking and data to programming and cybersecurity. I also advise the <strong>Coding Club</strong>, where students get hands-on experience with Python and work on projects of their own design.</p>

								<h3>Yale University</h3>
								<p>During my five years as a Teaching Fellow at Yale, I discovered something I hadn't fully expected: I loved teaching. Running weekly discussion sections gave me the chance to slow down and really engage with students' questions — to find out where understanding was breaking down and figure out, together, how to rebuild it. Working alongside Prof. Debra Fischer and Prof. Michael Faison, both gifted educators, taught me a great deal about how to make challenging ideas feel accessible and genuinely exciting. Those years in the classroom shaped the kind of teacher I wanted to become.</p>

								<ul>
									<li>ASTR 130: Origins &amp; Search for Life in the Universe, Prof. Debra Fischer (Fall 2015, Fall 2016, Spring 2020)</li>
									<li>ASTR 135: Archaeoastronomy, Prof. Michael Faison (Spring 2016)</li>
									<li>ASTR 120: Galaxies and the Universe, Prof. Michael Faison (Spring 2015)</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Williams College</h3>
								<p>My journey as an educator really started at Williams, where I spent three years as a Teaching Assistant and Head Teaching Assistant at the Milham Planetarium and Hopkins Observatory. As Head TA at the planetarium, I presented shows to school groups, astronomy classes, and the general public — and I trained other student lecturers to do the same. There is something uniquely powerful about standing under a dome full of stars and watching someone experience the night sky in a new way. I also worked at the Hopkins Observatory, guiding students through telescope observations and one-on-one tutoring. More recently, I've returned to Williams as an invited guest lecturer in undergraduate astronomy courses covering planets, the Milky Way, and stellar physics.</p>

								<h3>Private Tutoring and Mentoring</h3>
								<p>Since 2019, I've worked privately with high school and college students across a range of subjects, including IB Physics, Chemistry, Algebra II, SAT Math prep, and Python programming. At the college level, I've tutored students in calculus-based electricity and magnetism — a course many students find to be a genuine turning point in their physics education.</p>

								<p>Some of my most rewarding work has been mentoring students through independent research projects. Guiding a motivated teenager through their first real scientific investigation — helping them form a question, design a method, wrestle with unexpected results, and present their findings — is one of the most meaningful things I do. It's the kind of experience that can genuinely change a student's relationship to science.</p>
